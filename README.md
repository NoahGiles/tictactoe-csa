# tictactoe csa
 It's tic-tac-toe.
 It asks you if you want to play, then proceeds to show you the 9 available spaces. After every input on the user's side, the computer will go and randomly pick an available space. To win, the user must get 3 spaces on the board in a row. If the user cannot do this fast enough, the game ends in a tie. The user is then asked if they would like to play again.
